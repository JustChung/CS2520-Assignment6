# CS2520-Assignment6
Refactoring GraphicsV4 Pygame file

This project is a group assignment with 3 group members Carter Phung, Justin Chung, and Shawn Arlantico where we refactored the provided codebase. We started off by forking the original project and collaborated with each other in order to refactor the codebase. We have modified the project to make the code more flexible and allow the code to be easily modified, including altering object locations, quantities, and sizes. This refactored project is now easily adaptable to various requirements or design preferences. We have made the code structured in a modular way that is easy to maintain, and that adheres to the best practices and coding conventions for clarity and readability. We have used structural programming techniques in order to make the code into a functional form, by adding many functions, comments, and organizing the code better to make it more clear, concise, and reusable. The reusable functions can be easily combined and modified as needed. We put messages in each new version in order to know what was changed between the different versions. Git allowed us to collaborate effectively on the project, track changes, and resolve conflicts that may arise during the development process. In the end, we published the final refactored project onto a GitHub page. You can view the history of all the changes and collaboration on the GitHub page as well.

In order to run the file you need to have Python and Pygame installed.
